            <p class="smallIntro">Bali has long been a tourist paradise, a destination that combines staggering natural beauty with a vibrant culture. Now, thanks to Mulia, it has hotels and villas that are as luxurious as the island
                is magical.

                <p>The island of Bali is the pearl in the Indonesian archipelago, 
                and one of the world's most desirable holiday locations. 
                It's a haven of spirituality: an island of exquisite Hindu 
                temples and ornate handmade crafts, the home of Gamelan music 
                and Wayang puppet theatre. It's also a region of outstanding 
                natural beauty: of lush mountains and awe-inspiring volcanoes; 
                a place where coral reefs lie just beyond pristine beaches with 
                sands that can be snow-white or jet-black. It's a destination 
                that begs to be explored by divers, snorkelers, surfers, birdwatchers, 
                cyclists and intrepid tourists.</p>

                <br>

                <p>It's also, finally, home to a luxury resort that befits 
                this natural and cultural paradise. The Mulia and the 
                Mulia Resort & Villas were opened less than two years ago 
                but have already won numerous international awards and commendations 
                as one of the world's finest luxury hotels. The ultra-high-end Mulia 
                offers 111 boutique suites and individualised butler service; the Mulia 
                Resort has 526 suites and lagoon pool rooms, while you can take your pick 
                from more than a hundred Mulia Villas, ranging in size from one to six 
                bedrooms, all nestled amid terraced hills and private gardens.</p>

            <br>

            <div class="textTwo">        
                <p>Occupying more than 30 hectares, these three resorts are situated 
                in the luxury enclave of Nusa Dua, home to Bali's most stunning 
                seafronts. Residents have exclusive access to more than a kilometre 
                of private beach, with conditions perfect for sea swimming. There 
                are also a variety of sporting activities on offer, from kayaking to 
                tennis lessons, from a top-of-the-range gym to aqua-aerobics or yoga-stretching.
                </p>
        
                <br>

                <p>In keeping with Bali's spiritual ambience, the renowned Mulia Spa offers 
                treatments which incorporate Western, Balinese and Asian techniques. Guests 
                are encouraged to follow their holistic paths with assorted massages, body 
                scrubs, mud wraps and deep cleansing. You can relieve stress with the Mulia's 
                chromatherapy system and its hydrotherapy pools, or enjoy the steam rooms and 
                Finnish saunas. There is also Asia's only ice room, part of a hot-and-cold
                therapy programme in which clients alternate between steamy and icy environments, 
                stimulating circulation and boosting the immune system.

            <div class="textThree">    
                <p>Unique to Bali, the Mulia has been designed in an elegant contemporary manner, 
                using a variety of stunning marbles, stone, ceramics and glass across the resort.
                All of which seamlessly flow through the resort's private gardens and expansive 
                beachfront. The Mulia also offers an incredible array of dining options 
                including bars, cafes and restaurants which offer a rich variety of culinary 
                options, including Mediterranean and Pan-Asian cuisine, with Thai, Vietnamese, 
                Japanese and Indonesian influences. Expect everything from Thai salads to sushi; 
                from barbecued pork to Indian buttered chicken; from Sicilian pastas to exquisite
                sorbets – all with the choice of luxury indoor tables or beachfront dining.
                </p>
                  
                <br>
                   
                <p>The Mulia, Mulia Resort & Villas is an ideal destination for couples – 
                the resort even offers three unique venues for weddings, vow renewals 
                or special ceremonies – but they also cater for families and groups of
                all sizes, with a state-of-the-art Kids Club in a dedicated area of the 
                resort to allow families to enjoy maximum privacy.

                <br>
                       
                <p>There is nowhere in Bali – and few places on earth – 
                to rival the understated opulence of The Mulia, Mulia 
                Resort & Villas. Relaxed yet polished, stylish yet discreet,
                it's the perfect place to enjoy paradise.</p>
